Hashmaps are stored as Array of Linked Lists

[1] put(key,value);
[2] hash f(x) ------> gives BUCKET INDEX
[3] loop Linked List in bucket to check if key is present
        * if found ----> updates value of key
        * if not -----> add new node to Linked List
[4] hash function gives that key is present at which index of array {it does it in O(1) complexity }
[5] we divide all nodes among array to have equal number of nodes at each index of array
        if N (length of array) = 4,
           n (no. of linked list nodes) = 7
        then, Lambda =n/N = 7/4 =1.75
        therefore, it is searched in O(1.75) complexity

        lambda <= k(constant threshold value)

Hence, it is done in Constant time complexity

if lambda reaches the value of k, we do rehashing

FOR REHASHING,
[1] we will create a new array of length double of old array
